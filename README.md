Plant Store
============

This is a React application for a Plant store that allows users to browse different types of plants, discover detailed information about different plants. The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router DOM for navigation, and React Hook Form for form handling.

Installation
------------

To get started, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/wozzzie/react-application.git`

`npm install`

Usage
-----

To start the development server, run:

`npm run dev`

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000/`.

To build the application for production, run:

`npm run build`

This will build the application and generate static files in the `dist` directory.

To preview the built application, run:

`npm run preview`

This will start a server that serves the built application from the `dist` directory.

Testing
-------

To run tests, run:

`npm test`

This will run all tests in the `__tests__` directory.

To generate test coverage, run:

`npm run coverage`

This will generate a coverage report in the `coverage` directory.
